# Pokemon

There is no doubt that we spent the majority of our youth watching anime, particularly Pokemon; we have seen and experienced it all. With Hacktoberfest 2022 approaching and me being one of the first people as maintainer, I decided to make this repository, which is essentially a very basic web-page that allows the user to browse and upload their favourite pokemons.

You can find all types characters on https://pokemon.gameinfo.io/
# Contents of the Webpage

1. index.html - Contains the content of the main/home page.
2. index.css -  Contains the styling given to the  home page.
3. about.html - Contains a little information about me.

# What can you contribute?

Whether you are a rookie or a veteran, you can always offer something to a project. You may add your favourite character to the internet as a card in this project! Or perhaps you don't like the line you're reading right now and want to alter it. Sure! So why not?

# But what if i don't know how to add cards? :(

Everyone is not aware of every tool available in the world, no matter how simple or sophisticated it is. It's also not required to be familiar with every tool available. To add your own card, use the code below!

```
         <div class="card mb-3" style="max-width: 578px">
          <div class="row g-0">
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <img
                src="images/pikachu.png"
                class="img-fluid rounded-start"
                alt="..."
                data-aos="zoom-in"
                data-aos-duration="1000"
                data-aos-delay="60"
                style="width: 100%"
              />
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-8">
              <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title">Pokemon Name</h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Pokemon description
                </p>
                <p class="card-text electric">Pokemon Type</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
```

Copy this code and paste it in the index.html file to make your changes. Try and test it on your own system and then create a Pull request. You can adjust height of image of character so that it will fit in card.

After this you just have to add correct class color to the pokemon type by changing the existing "yellow" to respective class color.
For correct colors refer the same website.

```
   .electric (Class name if the same color class doesn't exist) {
      background-color: yellow (Change the color here);
      width: 50%;
      border-radius: 5px;
      text-align: center;
  }
```
