                    brown eyes with two distinctive lightning bolt-like markings (maybe cheeks) underneath each
                    one.While Ash wears a few different outfits, he always wears a baseball cap, which changes depending
                    on the region he is in. Without a cap, Ash is shown to have a cowlick and a narrow, triangular, and
                    edgy tuft of hair in the middle of his forehead that comes to a point on the right side.

                    usually helping and befriending them through his long journey.Ash's strategy and tactics in battle
                    are usually problem-solving, including thinking on his feet during special matches or that relate to
                    the special and unique abilities of Pokémon. Also, Ash even takes input from his friends and has
                    always helped him whenever he was stuck in a jam.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        <h5>Appearance :- </h5>Gary Oak is a tall, thin young man with light skin, brown eyes, and tall, brown spiky hair.He wears a long purple shirt, dark gray pants, a yin and yang necklace, and brown boots with black straps encircling them.<br>
                        Occasionally, he wears a brown cloak during his travels.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <h5>Personality :- </h5>The day Gary started out on his Pokémon journey, he came off as an arrogant and egotistical Trainer. His chosen First partner Pokémon was Squirtle, which was actually the same Pokémon that Ash originally wanted to start with, and he even had a group of cheerleaders who cheered him on in all of his battles, and they would go so far as crying whenever he lost. He didn't walk on his journeys like most Trainers did; instead he had his own sporty red convertible with a chauffeur. Gary loved when he got a chance to make fun of Ash by bragging about how far behind Ash was compared to him. He also gave Ash the pet-name of "Ashy-boy", which occasionally seems to annoy him. His style of training at that point was to capture many Pokémon and to use the strongest, as a stark contrast to Ash, who was more focused on developing a bond with his Pokémon.

                        <p>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        <h5>Appearance :- </h5>He wore an orange t-shirt, a lime green cargo vest with 4 pockets, a dark brown belt with a gold buckle and dark red pockets, brown jeans and blue-gray sneakers with white trim.He also has spiky brown hair and tan skin, notably darker than the skin of any other major character in the anime.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <h5>Personality :- </h5>Brock is considered the most mature, wise and levelheaded of the main characters and he is arguably the most intelligent character as well. He will usually place others before himself and will help and support his friends even against his better judgment or at his own expense. While he does not battle often, he can understand situations and strategies in any Pokémon battle, and often explains them to the other characters, probably because he was once a Gym Leader. His wisdom is possibly derived from how observant he is; he can tell just by sight how a Pokémon is feeling.
