          <p>As a Bulbasaur undergoes evolution into Ivysaur and then later into Venusaur, the bulb on its back blossoms into a large flower.The seed on a Bulbasaur's back is planted at birth and then sprouts and grows larger as the Bulbasaur grows.The bulb absorbs sunlight which allows it to grow, and for this reason, Bulbasaur enjoy soaking up the sun's rays.They can also survive for days without eating because the bulb stores energy.</p>

        <p>The end of a Charmander's tail is alight with a flame, and the flame's size reflects both the physical health and the emotions of the individual.When it rains, steam is said to spout from the tip of its tail.If the flame were to ever go out, the Charmander would die.When Charmander receives enough experience from battles, it evolves into Charmeleon (at level 16 in the video games), and later Charizard</p>

          <p class="card-text">Squirtle, known as the Tiny Turtle Pokémon, are turtle Pokémon with large eyes and chubby cheeks, capable of moving either on two feet or on all fours. Their skin is a light blue, and they possess a long, curled tail.</p>
          <p>When feeling threatened, Squirtle withdraw their limbs into their brown-orange shells and spray water from their mouth with great force, either to attack their opponent or merely to intimidate it.If attacked anyway, their shells are resilient, and provide excellent protection. It shelters itself in its shell, then strikes back with spouts of water at every opportunity.Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection. The shell's rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.</p>

          <p>Gengar are typically mean-spirited and enjoy tormenting people, hurting them and overtaking them. They are most active during full moons, creeping out in the dead of night and disguising themselves as shadows; they may even enters sleeping homes to lurk in the dark. They will mimic every movement their targets make until they lower their guards. Then, they strike, draining their victims' life force as sustenance.</p>
